    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><img src="../Basic-Portfolio/assets/images/photoId.jpg" alt="Photo">Born in Vietnam, I immigrated to the United States 
    in 1990 to a little known place called Whittier, California. Graduated high school in Whittier and received my 
    Finance degree from Cal State Fullerton. </p>
    <p>When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have
        connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earh, the separate and equal station to which
        the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
        should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
    <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
        certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights
        governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.</p>
